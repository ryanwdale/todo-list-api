Ruby on rails RESTful API providing todo list functionality. 

To run the API locally first you must have version 2.6.3 of ruby installed. Once that's done simply run: 
```
bundle install
```

followed by:
```
rails server -p 3001
```

Then head on over to the [client side](https://github.com/ryanwdale/todo-list-frontend) of this project.
